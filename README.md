# Introduction

The main functionality of the app is to allow users to enter a prompt and receive a simulated AI response.
It's just the result of a quick test of React Native back then, for the purpose of learning (and fun !)
The UI is quickly styled to resemble ChatGPT, with a clean and modern look.
I updated it recently and cleaned it a bit with some reset etc so normally everything is up to date (it was on my PC since a while), I thought it'd be nice to share.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Users can type their prompt into a centered text input field.
- **Send Button**: A button to send the prompt, which shows a loading state while waiting for the response.
- **Response Display**: The AI response is displayed in a centered scrollable container.

## Installation

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npx expo start` to start the app.
3. Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code and open the app on your device.
4. Enjoy!
